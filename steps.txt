Todo for project


Report:

Collecting data:
-Scraping URLs
-Spamming colleges
- Challenges with spamming

Cleaning data:
-one hot encoding vs get_dummies vs custom

PCA? K-means?


Cleaning:

data that needs to be split:
commute type
pain location
pain timing
mediccal treatment

data made ordinal:
commute time
sitting time
posture concern

physical activity



Approaches:


Pre
- clean countries
- remove unnecessairy features (email, city, name, etc)

1. Ordinal:

- convert data into oridnal values and run kmeans
- run PCA
- run k means on PCA
- create target columns for 1. poor posture (<=2) and 2. Back pain (>=4)
- run logistic regression predicting poor posture
- run logistic regression predicting back pain
- run random forest for predicting poor posture
- run random forest for predicting back pain
- explore important variables in poor posture
- explore important variables in back pain
- Knn

2. Dummy variables

- convert data into dummy variables 
- no PCA or Kmeans
- run kmodes on data 
https://github.com/nicodv/kmodes/issues/8   - how do we evaluate number of clusters?
- attempt to visualize
- extract meaning from cluster
- create target columns for 1. poor posture (<=2) and 2. Back pain (>=4)
- run logistic regression predicting poor posture
- run logistic regression predicting back pain
- run random forest for predicting poor posture
- run random forest for predicting back pain
- run logistic regression & rf predicting where back pain is
- explore important variables in poor posture
- explore important variables in back pain
- Knn



4.  Compare results between approaches
- better overall predictions
- any major differences?

5. Interactive Survey
- Create survey/ questionaire
- Output prediction for back pain and posture
- Output posture suggestions

6. Report

Data Collection

Data Cleaning/ visualizing

Clustering:
- Handling categorical/mixed features
- How to find optimal number of clusters for kmodes issue
- silhoutte analysis with jacard



Predicitons:

where they have the pain
when they have the pain
What position they sleep in
How active they are



Go through and do TOC links
Add comments to code
Add more visuals to eda section
put on github
?go back to multiclass output classifiers and try to do them one at a time?
